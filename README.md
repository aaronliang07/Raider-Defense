# Raider_Defense

I started learning the Godot game engine in April 2020 as a quarantine project, and Raider Defense is the culmination of my Godot journey so far. It's a tower defense game which takes inspiration from Bloons and others from the genre. I coded the game entirely from scratch, using Godot's Python-like GDScript. It's around 90% complete right now, just missing a couple of features which I hope to have the time to add in soon. Give it a download from the link below and try it out!

Download the zip file and run the .exe. Make sure the .pck is in the same folder or else it won't run.

There's also some sample code in the docs if you're interested.
